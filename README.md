# AI Agent Flows 🤖

A collection of ready-to-use workflow templates for building intelligent AI agents using **[n8n](https://n8n.io)** and **[Langflow](https://www.langflow.org)**.

## 🚀 What's Inside

This repository provides workflow templates for:
- 💬 **Conversational AI** - Chatbots with memory and context awareness
- 🔍 **Intelligent Search** - Vector-powered semantic search systems
- 🤝 **Integration Bots** - Connect AI to messaging platforms and APIs
- 📊 **Data Processing** - Automated AI-powered data workflows
- 🧠 **RAG Systems** - Retrieval-augmented generation implementations

## 🛠️ Platforms

### [n8n](https://n8n.io)
A powerful workflow automation tool that allows you to connect various services and build complex automations with a visual interface. Perfect for creating AI agents that integrate with multiple APIs and services.

### [Langflow](https://www.langflow.org)
A UI for LangChain that enables visual construction and experimentation with LLM-powered applications. Ideal for prototyping and deploying conversational AI agents.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **n8n** instance (self-hosted or cloud) - [Get Started](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/)
- **Langflow** installation - [Installation Guide](https://docs.langflow.org/getting-started)
- API keys for AI services (OpenAI, gemini, etc.)
- Additional service credentials as needed
